## Celebration Reminder API

**Status:** ðŸš§ Work in Progress

Welcome to my Celebration Reminder API project! This API is being developed to manage and track celebrations, reminders, and related data. Itâ€™s designed to provide a backend for an application that help users keep track of important events, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and other special occasions.

### Features

- **User Management:** Basic user profile management with roles and authentication.
- **Event Tracking:** Create, update, and track events such as birthdays and anniversaries.
- **Reminders:** Set and manage reminders for events.
- **Contact Management:** Store and manage contact information.
- **Address Management:** Manage addresses associated with contacts.

### Current Status

This project is currently a work in progress. Hereâ€™s what has been done so far:

- **Models:** Basic models for `User`, `Contact`, `Address`, `Event`, `Reminder`, and other related entities have been defined.
- **Database Schema:** The initial database schema is being developed, including tables and relationships.

### TODO

- **API Endpoints:** Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations on models.
- **Authentication:** Add user authentication and authorization features.
- **Validation:** Implement input validation and error handling.
- **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests.
- **Documentation:** Complete API documentation and usage examples.
